# SpecialNeedsAnalysis-Angular

  The Special Needs Analysis web application is designed to help those who have special- 
  needs visualize personal expenses, government aid, and disability program eligibilities.
  
The Frontend application was developed by Timothy Stumper, Troy Dunbar, and me.
  
My role in this project was to assess all handling of data, interfaces, and web services. I also contributed to page routing and web design.
